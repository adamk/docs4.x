# Use WinSCP to access your share files

You can use **WinSCP** to access your share files with the file sharing function of **GL-Routers**.

Please setup your **WebDAV** links in our network storage tab. For detail setup, please refer to the setup [WebDVA](https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/4/interface_guide/network_storage/#set-up-webdav)

## Setup links in WinSCP

After setup your WebDAV, you can go back to the **Share Folders** page of network storage.

Launch WinSCP and select WebDAV, also select the TLS/SSL encryption. Then paste the link to the **Host name**, the port number will automatically change to 6008.
