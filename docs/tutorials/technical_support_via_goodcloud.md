# Technical Support via GoodCloud

Sometimes it is necessary to get technical support from GL.iNet staff and they may ask you to share the your device using GoodCloud. This guide will show you how to share your device with GL.iNet staff.

## Enable GoodCloud management and remote control

In order to troubleshoot modem issues, you will need to give an extra Internet connection to the router to ensure the Internet stability. Please use the cable or repeater to build the 2nd connection and make sure it works.

Then in the router's admin panel, enable GoodCloud and Remote Access.

- For firmware version 4.7.x or higher, go to CLOUD SERVICES > GoodCloud, enable Remote SSH and Remote Web Access, click on Apply. As per the following picture.

Sometimes, new users may not be able to send a private message to GL.iNet technical support. In that case, you can respond in the same thread where you're communicating and ask the technical supporter to send you a private message first.
