# Can I use Multi-WAN wired input if my GL router doesn't have two WAN ports?

Yes, you can. Our router supports most common Ethernet to USB-A adapters. Simply plug the Ethernet to USB-A adapter into the USB port on the router and connect the other end to your ISP router.

For instance, if youâ€™re using a Realtek adapter, please select the **kmod-usb-net-rtl8152** driver. 

## Connect by Tethering

Once the installation is complete, the USB connection will be detected, allowing you to connect to your ISP router.
