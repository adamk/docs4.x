# Can I connect an Ethernet-only device to Wi-Fi using GL.iNet router?

Yes, you can.

If your device only supports Ethernet connectivity but needs to connect to a wireless network, a GL.iNet router can bridge this gap.

A GL.iNet router can act as an Ethernet-to-Wi-Fi bridge for devices that only have a wired connection, allowing them to join a wireless network. This is achieved by configuring the router as Repeater.

Please connect your device to the LAN port of the router and then set up [repeater](../interface_guide/internet_repeater.md).
