This is due to the Finder will add attributes to the file before transfer and making the file is different from original for coping. You can solve this issue by:

Method 1. Change your storage device into **NTFS** format.

Method 2. Use the **cp -X file-name** command to copy the file.

    Or use **cp -rX floder-name** command to copy the folder.
