# What is LuCI?

LuCI is the web user interface of OpenWrt, where you can perform some advanced settings.

It is an open and independent project maintained by OpenWrt. GL.iNet is not responsible for LuCI maintenance.

To access LuCI, navigate to SYSTEM from the left side of web Admin Panel -> Advanced Settings.

Enter the login password, which is the same as the password of the web admin panel.

You will be logged into the LuCI page. This is an example of the LuCI page for GL-AX1800 (Flint).
