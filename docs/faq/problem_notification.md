# Critical Problem Notification for GL-MT2500/GL-X3000/GL-XE3000

Dear GL.iNet Customers,

This announcement addresses the startup failure and firmware recovery issues via U-Boot on the GL-MT2500/GL-X3000/GL-XE3000 devices. The problem stemmed from a software defect where some parameters were incorrectly defined, causing the routers to operate abnormally. As a result, we assessed that this issue might reduce the routers' service life to some extent, for which we sincerely apologize.

To completely resolve this issue, we strongly recommend that all users of GL-MT2500, GL-X3000, and GL-XE3000 perform both a U-Boot bootloader upgrade and a firmware upgrade. Both upgrade procedures are essential and should not be omitted.

Even if your device has already been upgraded to the latest firmware, a U-Boot bootloader upgrade remains mandatory to prevent potential issues. After completing the U-Boot bootloader upgrade, if the latest firmware is already installed, you may skip reinstalling the firmware.
