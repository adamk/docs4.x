If you are stuck at the "Rebooting" screen when rebooting your router's firmware, follow these steps to resolve the issue:

After each step, check if the issue is resolved. If resolved, skip the remaining steps.

1. Wait for at least 5 minutes to see if the rebooting process completes on its own. The rebooting process can sometimes take longer than expected, especially after a firmware update.

2. If the rebooting process does not complete after 5 minutes, power off your router by unplugging the power cable. Wait for 30 seconds, then plug the power cable back in and wait for the router to boot up.

3. In a web browser, enter `192.168.8.1`. If the reverting process was successful, you will be directed to the setup guide.

4. Enable the private/incognito mode of your browser, enter `192.168.8.1`. If the reverting process was successful, you will be directed to the setup guide.

5. Use a different browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Safari) to enter `192.168.8.1`. If the reverting process was successful, you will be directed to the setup guide.

6. If you still cannot access the router's web Admin Panel or the router is not functioning properly, try resetting the router to its factory default settings by follow [this](repair_network_or_reset_firmware.md/#reset-to-factory) guide.
