# Do I have to configure Ethernet WAN when using VPN?

The answer is No. You can configure any WAN source for your GL.iNet router when setting it as VPN client. Your LAN and WLAN will be covered by VPN tunnel.

## Configure by WiFi Repeater

You can connect the GL.iNet router (set as VPN client) to your primary router wirelessly, in this way the GL.iNet router will function as a WiFi Repeater.
