You may get this alert from your browser if this is your first time to setup your GLiNet routers.

This is a general warning from browsers if the browsers detect a website without a SSL certicate.

## Is it safe to browse 192.168.8.1?

We are valued your network security, therefore during the first time setup, you do not need to connect to any internet source.

You may also notice when you connect to the GLiNet router's WiFi during setup, it will display you **"connected, No internet"**

![nointernet](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/faq/warning_from_your_browser/nointernet.jpg){class="glboxshadow"}

Our setup IP **192.168.8.1** is a device IP, this is used for access the device itself. It is not a website but a private IP. Therefore, no internet connection is needed before the setup. Because there is **No internet connection**, there is no leak of any kinds of your privacy. It is a private connection.

## Why I still get a warning?

Since the browsers do not distinguish the setup IP is not a website and all browsers classified IP addresses are websites, therefore browsers will detect if the website is safe or not by a SSL certificate.
A real safe website will have a SSL certificate, thus browsers trigger the alert since they do not find a SSL certificate in our routers.

## What can I do with this alert?

Please click **Advanced** and **Continue to 192.168.8.1**

## Can I add a SSL certicate in the router?

Yes, you can add your SSL certicate in the GLiNet routers.
