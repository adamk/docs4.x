# How to repair network or reset to factory setting

All GL.iNet Routers have a reset button, which you can use to restore network connectivity or reset the router to factory defaults. If you cannot access the router's web Admin Panel, you can press the reset button. 

It is important to note that you should wait for the router to fully boot up before performing a reset. Do NOT press the reset button immediately after powering on the router, as this may lead to the U-Boot failsafe mode.

## Repair network

Press and hold the reset button for **4 seconds** then release to perform a soft reset, which can repair your network.

This operation will reboot the network interface and restore the Internet interface to default settings, while preserving Wi-Fi settings, VPN settings, system settings, etc. 

**Note**: If WiFi has been disabled, a soft reset will restore WiFi to its default enabled state.

A soft reset can also be used to quickly switch from non-router mode to router mode.

## Reset to factory

There are two ways to reset the firmware.

1. Using reset button

    Press and hold the reset button for **10 seconds** then release to reset the router to factory settings. All user data will be cleared.

    **Note:** If the factory reset is not working. You might need to follow the [Uboot tutorial](debrick.md) to debrick your router.

2. Reset firmware in web Admin Panel

    If you can access the web Admin Panel, you can reset firmware to factory.

    On the left side of web Admin Panel -> SYSTEM -> Reset Firmware

    **Note:** All your current settings, applications and data will be lost. The process will take about 3 minutes. DO NOT power off the router during this process.
