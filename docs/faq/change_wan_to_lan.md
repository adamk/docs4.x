# Change WAN to LAN

You can change the WAN port of your router to be a LAN port. This is particularly useful when using the router in repeater mode, where the WAN port is unnecessary. As a result, you will have an additional LAN port for expanded connectivity.

Follow the steps below to change WAN to LAN.

1. Leave the WAN port unconnected.

2. Connect a device to the router and access the web Admin Panel.

3. Go to **Internet** -> **Ethernet** section, where it display the WAN port status is **Using as WAN**. Click **Change to LAN**.
