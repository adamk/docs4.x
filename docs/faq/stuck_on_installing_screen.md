After each step, check if the issue is resolved. If resolved, skip the remaining steps.

1. Verify whether the firmware update was successful. 
    1. In a web browser, enter `192.168.8.1` and log in. 
    2. Check the firmware version at the top and whether it matches the version you were updating to. If the version does not match, proceed to the next step.
2. Ensure a stable network connection, then re-upload the router's firmware.
3. Use a different browser (e.g., Edge, Safari) to re-upload the firmware.
