# How to add Brume 2 into GLiNet Mobile App

You can add your Brume 2 (GL-MT2500/GL-MT2500A) into the GLiNet Mobile App even if it has no WiFi feature. You can either set it as the main router or the secondary router.

The following methods are also applicable to Brume (GL-MV1000).

## Brume 2 as the Secondary Router

**Topology**

Here we have Slate AX (GL-AXT1800) as the main router and Brume 2 (GL-MT2500) as the secondary router.
