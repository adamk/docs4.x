# Upgrade Uboot Version

## Warning

**Upgrading U-Boot is very dangerous and generally not recommended. Once it fails, your device will be bricked and there will be no way to restore it. Only do this when necessary or instructed by GL.iNet support**.

**Do NOT turn off the power during the upgrade process, otherwise it may cause the upgrade to fail and the device to be bricked**.

## Preparation

- A computer with an ethernet port. If not, please prepare an additional USB Ethernet Adapter.
- An Ethernet cable.
- Download the Uboot file as per the instructions of the GL-iNet support staff. Mark sure you are using the correct uboot file. If you don't know how to download the Uboot file, contact us via email at support@gl-inet.com.

## Upgrade Steps

Please follow the procedures below to access the U-Boot upgrade page.

1. Remove the power of router. Connect your computer to the **Ethernet LAN port** of the router. You **MUST** leave all the other ports **unconnected**.

    !!! note

        For some models, certain individual LAN ports and the WAN port are interchangeable. Please do not use this LAN port. For example, on the GL-MT6000 (Flint 2), do not use LAN 1. Please use LAN 2, LAN 3, or LAN 4 instead.

2. Press and hold the Reset button firmly, at the same time power up the router. If your router doesn't have a power button, plugging the power in will power it on automatically.

    Then you will see a LED flashing in a regular sequence a few times, please release your finger after the sequence changes.
    
3. Manually set the IP address of your computer to **192.168.1.2**. Please check the step-by-step guide for different operating systems below:
