# I saw a error message "LAN subnet is in conflict...address"

When you plug an ethernet cable to the WAN port of GLiNet router, sometimes you might see this message.

![conflict](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/faq/what_should_i_do_with_subnet_conflict/conflict.jpg){class="glboxshadow"}

It is because your home router is using the same LAN IP of GLiNet router, and this is called a LAN conflict.

## Change the LAN Subnet

Please click the blue words **Change LAN Subnet** and it will re-direct you to the **LAN** setup page.

## Login with New Access IP

Please change the LAN IP **8** to **10** and then click **Apply**.

![login](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/faq/what_should_i_do_with_subnet_conflict/login.jpg){class="glboxshadow"}

It will change your access IP to **192.168.10.1** and please remember use this new IP for login next time.

Please log in with your password and the error message will be gone.
