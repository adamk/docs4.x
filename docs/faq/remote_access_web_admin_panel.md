# How to remote access the web Admin Panel of GL.iNet router?

- **Method 1**: If your router's network has a [public IP](../tutorials/how_to_check_if_isp_assigns_you_a_public_ip_address.md), please set up a [WireGuard Server](../interface_guide/wireguard_server.md) and use WireGuard to access the router's web Admin Panel. If you don't have a public IP, try other methods below.
- **Method 2**: Please [bind your device to GoodCloud](../interface_guide/cloud.md#setup), then you can [access the router's web Admin Panel remotely](../interface_guide/cloud.md#remote-access-web-admin-panel) by logging into the [GoodCloud website](https://www.goodcloud.xyz){target="_blank"}.
- **Method 3**: To use a SDWAN solution, we suggest [AstroWarp](https://www.astrowarp.net){target="_blank"}.
- **Method 4**: To use a reverse proxy solution, we suggest [AstroRelay](https://www.astrorelay.com){target="_blank"}.
