# REMOTE SUPPORT DISCLAIMER

Dear User,

Thank you for choosing products and services from GL.iNet (hereinafter referred to as “GL.iNet” or “we”). 

In order to better assist you in resolving the issues you have encountered, our technical support team will use the Anydesk software to connect remotely, identify the cause of the problems, and provide precise assistance. 

Before proceeding with any remote connection, please carefully read this statement and reply by email whether you accept remote operations. 

Should you disagree with the terms of this disclaimer, remote access will not be initiated. By proceeding with the remote connection, you acknowledge your full comprehension and acceptance of these terms.

## I. Purpose of Remote Connection

We use the remote connection solely to assist you in resolving technical issues related to GL.iNet products and services, including but not limited to:

1. Diagnosing and troubleshooting problems

2. Checking and modifying configurations of GL.iNet products and services

We commit not to view, collect, store, or disseminate any of your personal privacy data, files, or any other data unrelated to the technical support for GL.iNet products and services, nor will we install any software without your consent.

## II. Authorized Scope

To facilitate troubleshooting, you authorize us to:

1. **Obtain your Anydesk Remote ID with your explicit consent.**

    Prior to each remote connection, we will confirm your Anydesk remote ID and ensure it is not disclosed to any third party.

2. **Remotely control your computer screen and view or modify relevant information.**

    This primarily involves viewing your computer’s network information and accessing your router’s interface to check configuration details and perform other necessary operations related to our products or services, for the purpose of diagnosing and fixing issues. If, during inspection, we determine that the issue is caused by incorrect router configuration, we will modify the router configuration to resolve the problem.

3. **Permit the Anydesk software to handle information.**

    After our service provision using Anydesk, AnyDesk may retain operation logs. For details, please refer to [Anydesk Privacy Policy](https://anydesk.com.cn/en/privacy){target="blank"}.

## III. User Rights and Obligations

1. **Monitoring and termination rights**

    You have the right to monitor our operations during the entire remote connection and terminate the connection at any time or request our technical support staff to stop any operation.

2. **Obligation to ensure a secure environment**

    You are responsible for ensuring that, during the remote connection, your device is in a secure and stable network environment and for closing any applications or files that may contain personal or private information.

3. **Awareness of potential risks**

    You understand and agree that certain risks (e.g., network delays, connection interruptions) may arise during the remote connection, possibly resulting in unsuccessful operations or data loss.

4. **Scope of authorized assistance**

    You must not request us to handle or resolve any issues beyond the authorized scope or unrelated to our products or services.

## IV. Disclaimer

GL.iNet and its technical support staff shall not be held liable for the following situations:

1. **Remote operations by non-GL.iNet personnel**

    We are not liable for any data loss, disclosure, or damage, or for any direct or indirect losses arising from remote operations performed by personnel other than our own. You are advised to back up important data to prevent any risk of data loss.

2. **Responsibility limited to GL.iNet products and services**

    We are solely responsible for our own products and services. We do not provide any guarantee or assume any responsibility for any other products or services.

3. **Losses due to user actions or network issues**

    We assume no liability for any losses caused by your own operational errors, failure to follow instructions, failure to provide necessary information, or network environment issues.

4. **Third-party software or hardware issues**

    We are not liable if our remote technical support service cannot proceed normally due to problems with third-party software or hardware.

5. **Force majeure**

    We assume no liability for any service interruptions, delays, or losses caused by force majeure events (e.g., natural disasters, war).

6. **No guarantee of problem resolution**

    You understand and agree that remote connection is merely an auxiliary troubleshooting method. GL.iNet does not guarantee the resolution of all technical issues, nor that it will meet all of your needs.
