    This guide is based on firmware v4.7.x. If you are using an earlier firmware version, please visit [here](wireguard_client_v4.6.md).

WireGuardÂ® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes **state-of-the-art cryptography**. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN.

If you have already bought WireGuard service from a provider, but you don't know how to get the configuration files, please refer to [get configuration files from WireGuard service providers](../tutorials/how_to_get_configuration_files_from_wireguard_service_providers.md) or ask its support.

You can set up WireGuard Client via web Admin Panel or [mobile app](../faq/mobile_app.md). 

**The mobile app** has already integrated some WireGuard service providers, such as AzireVPN, Mullvad VPN, OVPN, StrongVPN, PIA VPN, etc., which means you can easily set up WireGuard Client by simply enter the credentials of the WireGuard Service you purchased. Open the app and follow the instructions on it to set up.

**The web Admin Panel** not only integrates some WireGuard service providers, but also provides an entrance for manually uploading configuration files. You can either enter the purchased WireGuard service credentials for quick setup, or manually upload a configuration file to set up the WireGuard client.

Select your WireGuard service provider below to quickly locate the step-by-step instructions.
