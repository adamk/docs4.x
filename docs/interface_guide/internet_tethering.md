# Connect to the Internet via usb tethering

Using a USB cable to share network from your smartphone to the router is called Tethering. Host-less modem works in Tethering during the setup of the modem as well.

**Note:** Some mobile carriers limit or charge extra for tethering. We recommend checking with your carrier.

## Setup

=== "iPhone"

    1. Connect iPhone to the USB port of the router. It will pop up a message asking to trust this computer? Click "Trust" to contine. Because we are connecting the iPhone to the router, so here is to TRUST the router.
