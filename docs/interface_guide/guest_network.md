# Guest Network

The **guest network** has been separated from the [LAN](lan.md) since v4.5.

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> NETWORK -> Guest Network.

**Note**: Some models do not have WiFi (e.g. GL-MT2500/GL-MT2500A), so there is no Guest Network tab.

The **Guest Network** is a separate, isolated network designed for temporary users, providing limited access and enhanced security by segregating it from the primary network.

The **Default Gateway** is **192.168.9.1**, If you have enable the Guest WiFi and it conflicts with your network, you can change it.

The other basic setting and the DHCP server setting are the same as [LAN](lan.md).
