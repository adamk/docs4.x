# Reset Firmware

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> SYSTEM -> Reset Firmware

If the router malfunctions, you can try to resolve the issue by resetting the firmware. Click on the **Delete All and Reboot** button to reset the firmware.

**Note:** All your current settings, applications and data will be lost. The process will take about 2 minutes. DO NOT power off the router during this process.
