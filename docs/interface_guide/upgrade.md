# Upgrade

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> SYSTEM -> Upgrade, you can upgrade the router's firmware version. For certain cellular models, you can also upgrade the module version if needed.

!!! Note

    Please keep the power on during the upgrade. Do **NOT** power off the router. The device will automatically reboot after upgrade, which may take a few seconds.

## Firmware Upgrade

### Online Upgrade

You can find the current firmware version here. If your router is connected to the Internet, it will check for the newer firmware version available for download.

**Preview Plan**

Enable the switch to get latest unstable updates, patches, improvements, and enhancements as soon as they're available. Set it once and it stays on (you always have the option to turn it off later).

## Module Upgrade

Starting from v4.4.12, GL.iNet cellular routers support upgrading the cellular module via web Admin Panel. You can try to upgrade the cellular module when cellular networking fails. 

### Online Upgrade
