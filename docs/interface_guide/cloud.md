## Setup your GoodCloud account

Users are required to follow the binding procedures specific to their firmware versions to successfully connect devices to the cloud platform.

Users need to first access the router's web interface (default address: 192.168.8.1) to enable cloud services. After that, they can complete the GoodCloud account registration and device binding on the cloud platform.

### For devices running firmware version 4.6 or earlier

#### Enable GoodCloud on router

![enable goodcloud](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/interface_guide/cloud/enable_goodcloud_1.png){class="glboxshadow"}

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> APPLICATIONS -> GoodCloud.

![enable goodcloud](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/interface_guide/cloud/enable_goodcloud_2.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Follow the steps above, to enable the GoodCloud function, which will allow the router to connect to the GoodCloud server.

* **Remote SSH** is for remote access router's terminal via GoodCloud. Check out [here](#remote-access-routers-terminal).

* **Remote Web Access** is for remote access router's web Admin Panel via GoodCloud. Check out [here](#remote-access-web-admin-panel).

* **Data Server**, please choose the server which is nearest your devices located. There are three Data Server, **Asia Pacific**(Japan), **America**(Oregon) and **Europe**(Ireland).

#### Sign up GoodCloud account

Visit [GoodCloud website](https://www.goodcloud.xyz){target="_blank"}, sign up then sign in.

If you don't find the verify email, look in spam or check email later. If you have any difficulty with sign up, please send email to [support@glinet.biz](mailto:support@glinet.biz) for help.

For the data server region, please select the region closest to you or the region where you wish the device to connect.

#### Add device in your account

![add device](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/interface_guide/cloud/add_devices_1.png){class="glboxshadow"}

On the left side -> Devices -> Bound Devices -> Add Device. There are three methods to bind device to your GoodCloud account, **Auto discover**, **Manually add** and **Bulk import**.

=== "Auto discover"

    If your router and computer(which opened GoodCloud website) are in the same network, please try the **Auto discover**.
    
    Follow the steps below to add your device.

    ![add device, auto discover](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/interface_guide/cloud/add_devices_auto.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    Check out [here](../faq/where_to_find_the_device_id_mac_sn.md) to find the Device ID.

    !!! note

        Input "DDNS/Device ID" here just to verify that the router is really original/valid.

    Click **Refresh** to force auto discover devices again.

=== "Manually add"

    If it can't discover automatically, try **Manually add**. All information that need to input can be found on the back of the router.

    !!! note

        Input "MAC", "SN" and "DDNS" / "Device ID" here just to verify that the router is really original and valid.

    For new models, it has **Device ID** on the back of router.

    ![manually add device](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/manually-add-device-device-id.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    For old models, it has **DDNS** on the back of the router. Only the first 7 characters of **DDNS** are needed.

    ![manually add device](https://static.gl-inet.com/goodcloud/docs/manually-add-device.png){class="glboxshadow"}

=== "Bulk import"

    **Bulk import** is for user who have a great number of devices to add. By **Bulk import** you can import many devices by a Microsoft excel file.

    ![bulk import](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/interface_guide/cloud/add_devices_bulk.png){class="glboxshadow"}

#### Bound info on router web Admin Panel

## Site to Site

Please refer to [GoodCloud Site to Site](../tutorials/goodcloud_site_to_site.md).

## GoodCloud and VPN

If you enable GoodCloud function and running VPN client at the same time on router, by default, the connection between the router and the GoodCloud server will not go through the VPN. This ensures a more stable connection to GoodCloud services.

However, if you want the GoodCloud connection to go through the VPN, you can change this setting in the router's web Admin Panel. Go to VPN -> VPN Dashboard -> VPN Client -> Global Options, and enable the option for GoodCloud to use VPN.

![Services from GL.iNet doesn't Use VPN](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/cloud/goodcloud_donot_use_vpn.png){class="glboxshadow"}

Note that routing GoodCloud through VPN may affect the stability of the cloud connection, especially if:

* The VPN connection is unstable
* The VPN provider filters or blocks GoodCloud traffic
* The VPN adds significant latency to the connection

It's generally recommended to keep the default setting where GoodCloud bypasses the VPN for optimal performance and reliability.

## View Logs

You can see your activities in GoodCloud Platform.

![View Logs](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/interface_guide/cloud/view_logs.png){class="glboxshadow"}

## Turn off cloud

To stop GoodCloud service, turn it off on router web Admin Panel. Please follow the steps below. No action needed on the GoodCloud website.
