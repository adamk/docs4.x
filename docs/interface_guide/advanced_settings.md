# Advanced Settings

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> SYSTEM -> Advanced Settings.

You can modify advanced settings with LuCI, the default web user interface of OpenWrt.

As an open and independent project maintained by OpenWrt, LuCI is provided as-is. GL.iNet is not responsible for LuCI maintenance.

Click on **Go To LuCI** button, you will be re-directed to the LuCI login page.

Enter the login password, which is the same as the password of the web admin panel.

You will be logged into the LuCI page. This is an example of the LuCI page for GL-AX1800 (Flint).
