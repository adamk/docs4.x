# UI Languages

This feature was added since v4.6.

If you need to add additional UI languages or update the UI text, Click the button at the bottom of the language toggle list on the right side of the title bar.

In "Management Interface Languages" pop-up window, select the language you need and click "Update" and the device will automatically get the latest version of the language pack from our repository. Unselected language packs will be deleted (except English).

If you need to get the latest version of the language pack automatically to revise possible text errors on the interface, please turn on "Enable Auto Update". When this option is enabled, the device will automatically get the latest version of the language pack at the time you set.
