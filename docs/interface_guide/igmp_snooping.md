# IGMP Snooping

You can enable IGMP snooping to use the multicast function on the router.

IGMP Snooping listens to the IGMP protocol package, extracts the corresponding information, establishes and maintains the layer 2 multicast forwarding publication, and then forwards the multicast group data to the host that joins the multicast group, while other hosts cannot receive the multicast group data.

**Note**: IGMPv3 is compatible with v1 and v2. Use v3 by default, and switch if you experience a problem.
