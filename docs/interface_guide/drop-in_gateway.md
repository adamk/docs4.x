# Drop-in Gateway

Please upgrade to v4.2.x to use this feature. There are some bugs in v4.1.x.

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> NETWORK -> Drop-in Gateway

## Usage Scenarios

For users who do not want to replace their main router, you can use this mode to extend the functionality of your main router.

* Use ADGuard Home to filter advertisements
* Use encrypted DNS
* Use VPN client
* It is recommended to use a more powerful router with large memory (e.g. GL-MT2500) and install other traffic forwarding and control tools yourself.

## Network Topology

![drop-in gateway mode typology](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/drop-in_gateway/drop-in_gateway_mode_topology.svg){class="glboxshadow gl-60-desktop"}

The diagram above has two colored lines, gray lines, and green lines with 3 arrows on the green lines, and a number next to each arrow.

1. The gray lines show that the devices are connected to the main router, and the LAN port of the main router is connected to the WAN port of the GL.iNet router with Drop-in Gateway function via an Ethernet cable.

2. The green lines indicate that when the Drop-in Gateway mode is enabled, all or part of the devices' data will be processed by the GL.iNet device before being sent out through the main router.

## Setup

There are two usage scenarios, where all devices can be managed by Drop-in Gateway or only some devices can be managed.

The GL.iNet router referred to below is the GL.iNet router on which you want to enable the Drop-in Gateway function. The router ip address of our main router here is 192.168.1.1.

### All devices managed by the Drop-in Gateway

1. The LAN port of the main router connect to the WAN port of the GL.iNet router via an ethernet cable.

2. Access web Admin Panel of GL.iNet router, enable Drop-in Gateway feature, it will generate the settings automatically.

    ![drop-in gateway generated settings](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/drop-in_gateway/drop-in_gateway_all_device_enabled.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    The **IP Address** is same of the IP address in [Ethernet sector of Internet page](internet_ethernet.md). The **Gateway** and **DNS Server 1** are the IP address of the main router. If these items are not set correctly, you can change them manually yourself.

    Write down the IP address here, you will use it in the following steps.

    You could choose the first configuration method, and click apply.

3. Log in to the main router's admin page.

    ??? "GL.iNet"

        If the brand of main router is GL.iNet and its version is v4.2 and above.

        Access web Admin Panel -> NETWORK -> LAN -> DHCP Server -> Advanced

        ![glinet lan advanced](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/drop-in_gateway/glinet/lan_advanced.png){class="glboxshadow"}

        Fill in the DHCP Gateway as the IP Address in step 2, etc. `192.168.1.23`, then click **Apply**.

4. Go back to the GL.iNet router and set up features like [ADGuard Home](adguardhome.md), [encypted DNS](dns.md), [WireGaurd Client](wireguard_client.md) and [OpenVPN Client](openvpn_client.md).

### Some devices managed by the Drop-in Gateway

1. The LAN port of the main router connect to the WAN port of the GL.iNet router via an ethernet cable.

2. Access web Admin Panel of GL.iNet router, enable Drop-in Gateway feature, it will generate the settings automatically.

    ![drop-in gateway generated settings](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/drop-in_gateway/drop-in_gateway_some_device_enabled.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    The **IP Address** is same of the IP address in [Ethernet sector of Internet page](internet_ethernet.md). The **Gateway** and **DNS Server 1** are the IP address of the main router. If these items are not set correctly, you can change them manually yourself.

## Cautions

1. It will increase the latency when using this mode.
2. When this mode is enabled, the data transferred between the selected devices in the LAN will also pass through the drop-in gateway, so the bandwidth between the main router and the drop-in gateway will affect the bandwidth of the whole LAN.
