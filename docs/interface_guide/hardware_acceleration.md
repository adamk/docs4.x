# Hardware Acceleration

**Note**: Hardware Acceleration features have been renamed to [Network Acceleration](network_acceleration.md) since v4.3.

Hardware acceleration reduces CPU load and speeds up traffic packet forwarding, but can conflict with some features.

When hardware acceleration is enabled, the following functions will not work properly: Client Speed and Traffic Statistics, Client Speed Limit.
